# NutsNews Documentation

Welcome to the NutsNews documentation hub.

This repository is the canonical documentation home for NutsNews web, NutsNews Worker, and NutsNews iOS. Keep product, operations, deployment, cache, automation, and environment documentation here instead of in the application repositories so documentation-only updates do not trigger app deployments.

This folder is organized by what you are trying to do: understand the product, change the platform, operate production, monitor risk, or debug problems.

## Documentation Standards

Keep docs:

- Short at the top
- Clear before detailed
- Action-oriented
- Easy to scan
- Linked from this index when they matter
- Archived when they become one-off notes

See [Documentation Style Guide](DOCUMENTATION_STYLE_GUIDE.md) for naming, structure, and wording rules.


## Vercel preview smoke test protection bypass

Protected Vercel preview deployments require the GitHub Actions secret `VERCEL_AUTOMATION_BYPASS_SECRET`, created from Vercel Project Settings -> Deployment Protection -> Protection Bypass for Automation. The live Playwright smoke test uses this secret only as an HTTP header and does not commit it to the repo.
